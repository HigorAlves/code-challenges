# React + Node Coding exercise

Before joining the coding exercise, you should have set up the local environments for the application. Install the Packages in both `backend` `frontend` and run `yarn dev` and `yarn start` respectively to start the developing server (remember to configure the .env file using the .env.example one). Also, we recommend you read the code so that you are not caught off guard.

# What does the coding exercise looks like?
