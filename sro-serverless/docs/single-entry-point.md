# Transition from Single Entry Point to Multiple Express Functions

## Overview

This document outlines the rationale behind transitioning from a single entry point architecture, where a monolithic
Express.js function handles all routes, to a microservices-oriented architecture. In this new approach, each serverless
function will be a lightweight Express.js application responsible for a single route or a closely related set of routes.
This decision is motivated by considerations around performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost efficiency.

## Reasons for Transition

### Improved Performance and Reduced Cold Start Latency

- **Targeted Scaling**: Each function can scale independently based on demand for its specific route, ensuring resources
  are allocated more efficiently and reducing latency for end-users.
- **Minimized Cold Starts**: Smaller, more specialized functions typically have fewer dependencies and a smaller
  footprint, leading to faster deployments and reduced cold start times.

### Enhanced Scalability and Resource Utilization

- **Independent Scaling**: Functions can scale based on the traffic to their specific routes, allowing for more granular
  and efficient scaling, which is particularly beneficial during uneven load distribution.
- **Resource Optimization**: By isolating routes, each function can be optimized for its specific workload, potentially
  reducing the amount of memory and compute resources required, which can lead to cost savings.

### Increased Reliability and Fault Isolation

- **Fault Isolation**: In a microservices architecture, issues in one function (e.g., crashes, slow performance) are
  less likely to impact other functions, enhancing the overall reliability of the application.
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: Isolating routes to specific functions simplifies monitoring and logging, making it easier
  to identify and resolve issues.

### Improved Maintainability and Development Workflow

- **Simpler Codebase**: Breaking down a monolithic function into smaller, route-specific functions can lead to simpler,
  more maintainable codebases where changes to one function are less likely to impact others.
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different functions simultaneously with reduced risk of merge conflicts or
  integration issues, speeding up the development process.

### Cost Efficiency

- **Optimized Execution**: With functions tailored to specific routes, execution time can be minimized, potentially
  leading to lower costs, as most serverless platforms charge based on execution time and resource consumption.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Routing**: Each function should include minimal routing logic, ideally dedicated to a single route or a small set of
  closely related routes.
- **Dependencies**: Limit dependencies to those necessary for the specific route handled by the function to reduce
  deployment size and cold start times.
- **State Management**: Consider how state is managed and shared across functions, especially if the application
  requires session persistence or shared context.
- **Security**: Ensure that each function is secured appropriately, implementing authentication and authorization as
  needed at the function level.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for each function to facilitate performance
  tracking and rapid issue resolution.

## Conclusion

Transitioning to a microservices architecture with multiple Express.js functions, each handling a specific route, offers
significant advantages in terms of performance, scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. This approach aligns with
modern cloud-native development practices, providing a flexible and robust framework for building and scaling web
applications.
